# Manifest #

## Purpose ##

Manifests are used by our authoring tool [Popcorn-Maker](http://mozillapopcorn.org/popcorn-maker/) to create meaningful editors.

Manifests are simply objects that contain data about who wrote the plugin, each option the plugin exposes ( start, end, target, ect ), as well as defining what type of element is best used to represent the specified option in the editor ( input, select, dropdown ) and the corresponding data for each of those elements ( an array of data for select and dropdown, text for input ).

## Options ##

* **about** \[Object\] - an object that defines who wrote this plugin
* **options** \[Object\] - an object containing various other objects for each option that is passed on to the user

## Use Case ##

You want your plugin to be used in butter

## Examples ##

The following example shows what a manifest might look like ( the googlemaps manifest in this example )

{% highlight js linenos %} 
    {
      about: {
        name: "Popcorn Google Map Plugin",
        version: "0.1",
        author: "@annasob",
        website: "annasob.wordpress.com"
      },
      options: {
        start: {
          elem: "input",
          type: "text",
          label: "In"
        },
        end: {
          elem: "input",
          type: "text",
          label: "Out"
        },
        target: "map-container",
        type: {
          elem: "select",
          options: [ "ROADMAP", "SATELLITE", "STREETVIEW", "HYBRID", "TERRAIN" ],
          label: "Type"

          label: "Lng"
        },
        location: {
          elem: "input",
          type: "text",
          label: "Location"
        },
        heading: {

          type: "text",
          label: "Heading"
        },
