# OpenMap #

## Purpose ##

Adds an OpenLayers map and open map tiles (OpenStreetMap \[default\], NASA WorldWind, or USGS Topographic)

## Options ##

* **start** \[Number\] - is the time that you want this plug-in to execute
* **end** \[Number\] - is the time that you want this plug-in to stop executing
* **target** \[String\] - is the id of the DOM element that you want the map to appear in. This element must be in the DOM
* **type** \[String\] - either: ROADMAP (OpenStreetMap), SATELLITE (NASA WorldWind / LandSat), or TERRAIN (USGS).  ROADMAP/OpenStreetMap is the default.
* **zoom** \[String\] - the amount the map is zoomed in, defaults to 2
* **lat and lng** \[String\] - are the coordinates of the map if location is not named
* **location** \[String\] - is a name of a place to center the map, geocoded to coordinates using TinyGeocoder.com
  * **markers** \[Array\] - is an array of map marker objects, with the following properties:
  * **icon** \[String\] - is the URL of a map marker image
  * **size** \[Number\] - is the radius in pixels of the scaled marker image (default is 14)
  *  **text** \[String\] - is the HTML content of the map marker -- if your popcorn instance is named 'popped', use &lt;script&gt;popped.currentTime(10);&lt;/script&gt; to control the video

* Note: using location requires extra loading time, also not specifying both lat/lng and location will cause a JavaScript error.

## Example ##

{% highlight js linenos %}
    var pop = Popcorn( "#video" );

    pop.openmap( {
      start: 0,
      end: 20,
      type: "ROADMAP",
      target: "map",
      lat: 43.665429,
      lng: -79.403323,
      zoom: "10"
    });
{% endhighlight %}
