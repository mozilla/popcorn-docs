# listen( eventName, callback ) #

## Purpose ##

Bind an [event](/popcorn-docs/events/) handling callback to an event. Allows custom events.

Any of the follow event types may be used with `listen()` : loadstart, progress, suspend, emptied, stalled, play, pause, loadedmetadata, loadeddata, waiting, playing, canplay, canplaythrough, seeking, seeked, timeupdate, ended, ratechange, durationchange, volumechange. Take a look at the [events section of our documentation](/popcorn-docs/events/) for further information on events.

## Options ##

* **eventName** \[String\] - name of the event to listen for
* **callback** \[Function\] - the function to execute when an event matching **eventName** is triggered.

## Use Cases ##

Perform an action when an event occurs, i.e, show a [googlemap](/popcorn-docs/plugins/#googlemap) when the video is paused
