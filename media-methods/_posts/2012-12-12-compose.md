# compose( name, definitionObject \[, manifest\] ) #

## Purpose ##

`compose()` provides the base logic for [effects](/popcorn-docs/effects/) and works similarly to a traditional [Popcorn.js plugin](/popcorn-docs/utility-methods/#plugin). Create start and end functions as you would in a typical plugin and add an appropriate effect that will be triggered in each block. Typically this means add an effect on start and remove it on end, but is in no way limited to this. Compose creates the huge potential for CSS transitions between [Popcorn events](/popcorn-docs/events/) and depth to the user's experience. `compose()` is not limited to effects.

Plugins events will be fired first, followed by composed events.

## Options ##

* **name** \[String\]- given name for the compose plugin
* **definitionObject** \[Object\]-  object containing typical plugin methods ( setup, start, end ) where the compose logic will live
* **manifest** \[Object\]- an optional [manifest](/popcorn-docs/plugins/#manifest) can be included

## Use Cases ##

* You want a unique effect to be displayed alongside an already existing plugin
* Create transitions
