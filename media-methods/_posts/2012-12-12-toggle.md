# toggle( pluginName ) #

## Purpose ##

`toggle()` allows you to easily turn plugin events of a specified type on and off. Note that toggling events on/off does not mean that they will be hidden when toggled off. It simply means that events of that type will no longer be fired, i.e `start`, `end`, `frame` will not be fired if toggled off.

## Options ##

* `**pluginName**` - string. The name of the plugin, i.e. "footnote"

## Use Cases ##

* Toggle a plugin on and off because of a user interaction
* Play the video through once without popcorn events and once with popcorn events

## Examples ##
