# toggle( pluginName ) #

## Purpose ##

`toggle()` allows you to easily turn plugin events of a specified type on and off. Note that toggling events on/off does not mean that they will be hidden when toggled off. It simply means that events of that type will no longer be fired, i.e start, end, frame will not be fired if toggled off.

## Options ##

* **pluginName** \[String\] - the name of the plugin, i.e. "footnote"

## Use Cases ##

* Toggle a plugin on and off because of a user interaction
* Play the video through once without popcorn events and once with popcorn events
