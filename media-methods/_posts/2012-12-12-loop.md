`loop()` is a passthrough accessor to the [HTMLMediaElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/HTMLMediaElement) property of the same name. When `loop( true )` is called the video will automatically start playing from the beginning each time it reaches the end. By default [Popcorn media](/popcorn-docs/media-properties/#media) will not loop.
