title: cue

# cue( time, callback ) #

## Purpose ##

`cue()` is a preferred alias to `exec()`.

`cue()` was created with film makers in mind by using a familiar keyword in order to make developing Popcorn.js projects simpler.

## Options ##

* **time** - number of seconds or SMPTE format string. The time in which the cue will be fired at
* **callback** - callback. Function to execute at the given `**time**`

## Use Cases ##

* Perform an action at some point in the video
* Unique functionality that is not big enough to warrant a plugin

## Example ##

[Log data at points in the video](http://jsfiddle.net/popcornjs/a38mA/)
