# load() #

## Purpose ##

`load()` is a passthrough accessor to the [HTMLMediaElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/HTMLMediaElement) property of the same name.  The `load()` method allows the user to force a reload of the current video, making it play from the beginning. The function takes no arguments. Once the video has loaded it will take its default state as it was set when the video was instantiated ( if it was [muted](#mute), if [autoplay](#autoplay) was set, etc ).

## Use cases ##

* Start the video from the beginning again
* Change a video source mid way through playback
