# controls( flag ) #

## Purpose ##

`controls()` is a passthrough accessor to the [HTMLMediaElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/HTMLMediaElement) property of the same name. If `controls( true )` is called, the video will be shown with its native set of controls ( play, timebar, volume, ect ). `controls( false )` will conceal the native control elements bar.

## Options ##

* **flag** \[Boolean\]- true to show or false hide the controls

## Use Cases ##

* [Autoplay](#autoplay) the video, showing no controls
* Show controls initially, then on play, hide the controls from the user

## Examples ##

* [Live demo that hide's controls](http://jsfiddle.net/popcornjs/z3z5w/)
* [Live demo that will show/hide controls every other second](http://jsfiddle.net/popcornjs/e7rys/)
