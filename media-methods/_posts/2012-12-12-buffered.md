# buffered() #

## Purpose ##

`buffered()` is a passthrough accessor to the [HTMLMediaElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/HTMLMediaElement) property of the same name. `buffered()` returns a [timeranges object](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/video.html#normalized-timeranges-object) that describes to the user how much of the video has been loaded.  The function takes no arguements.

## Use Cases ##

You want to wait until a certain amount of the video has been loaded before beginning playback or allowing the user to interact with the video
