# Popcorn.plugin( pluginName, definitionObject, manifest ) #

## Purpose ##

Creates a new Popcorn proto method of the name provided with the definitionObject.

All Popcorn instances will inherit this newly created method. See below for plugin authoring patterns; see the [Step-by-step instructions](http://popcornjs.org/creating-plugins) for creating Popcorn Plugins for detailed plugin authoring information.

## Options ##

* **pluginName** - will be the name for your newly created plugin.  Will also be the name of the instance method in which your plugin will be accessed through.
* **definitionObject** - an object in which the setup, start, end, teardown functions will be implemented for the given plugin
* **manifest** - an object that explains the given plugin.  Any options that are passed on to the user are documented here.  Manifest are read in by Popcorn-Maker in order to create a meaningful editor. A more [in-depth explanation can be found here]()

## Use Cases ##

Develop a plugin for a popular web service in order to extend additional content during a popcorn video
