title: null wrapper
---
# HTMLNullVideoElement( id ) #

## Purpose ##

The null wrapper is used to provide the user with an empty shell which emulates the [HTML5 video element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/HTMLVideoElement).  This allows the user to use Popcorn.js even without a media element ( video or audio ) which allows for events to be fired off just like your typical Popcorn instance.  All events, functions, and properties that Popcorn provides are extended onto the null wrapper for convenience.

## Options ##

* **id** \[String\] - just like using a video or audio source, you pass along the id of the HTML element which the null wrapper will use ( in the form of "#id", where id is the id of your element )

## Use Cases ##

The null wrapper has numerous use cases, such as :

* Wanting to use popcorn without a media
* Creating a bigger global timeline in which numerous smaller popcorn instances are created from

## Examples ##

{% highlight js linenos %}
    var wrapper = Popcorn.HTMLNullVideoElement( "#elementID" );

    // This is 60 in seconds, if you want fractions of a second, use 60.5
    wrapper.src = "#t=,60";

    var pop = Popcorn( wrapper );

    pop.play();

    // Add popcorn events here and other functionality
    pop.footnote({
      start: 1,
      end: 5,
      text: "Works with the wrapper!",
      target: "footnote-div"
    });
{% endhighlight %}
