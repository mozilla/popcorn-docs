# smart( id, url ) #

## Purpose ##

The Smart player allows the use of any existing player without specifying which player.

The idea is that Smart will try to find an acceptable player, given the id and url. Smart requires players to implement a _canPlayType( containerType, url ) function, along side _setup. This function returns true or false if the player can play this, given the container and url. A player that does not implement a _canPlayType will return undefined, which is inconclusive if the player can play it or not. Each player also exposes a canPlayType( container, url ) function that developer can use to query if their data can be played or not.

Smart will also work with video elements, and attempt to create an HTML5 video experience if possible. In this case, the container can be a video element or a div. If it is a div, a video element will be created and appended to the supplied div.

## Options ##

* **id** \[String\] - the id of the HTML element that the appropriate player will populate
* **url** \[String\] - the url of the media you wish to use

## Examples ##

{% highlight js linenos %}
    var pop = Popcorn.smart( "#video", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oar9glUCL0" );

    pop.footnote({
      start: 1,
      end: 5,
      text: "Works with youtube!",
      target: "footnote-div"
    });

    pop.play();
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight js linenos %}
    var pop = Popcorn.smart( "#video", "media.webm" );

    pop.footnote({
      start: 1,
      end: 5,
      text: "Works with youtube!",
      target: "footnote-div"
    });

    pop.play();
{% endhighlight %}
