    <p>Events in Popcorn.js work on a trigger and listen system.  You are able to trigger events to happen and all of that events listeners will be executed.  This makes it easy in Popcorn.js to perform actions at given moments during a video, for example, perform an action whenever the video is paused would simply consist of listen for the pause event and providing a callback function to perform your actions.</p>
    <h1>Coming soon...</h1>
    <p>This part of the documentation is currently being written and is under development.  In the meantime here is a list of standard HTML5 media events and there descriptions ( these may not be implemented yet for YouTube, Vimeo, and other players ).<p>

    <table border="1"> <tbody> <tr> <th>Event name</th> <th>Description</th> </tr> <tr> <td><code>abort</code></td> <td>Sent when playback is aborted; for example, if the media is playing and is restarted from the beginning, this event is sent.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>canplay</code></td> <td>Sent when enough data is available that the media can be played, at least for a couple of frames.&nbsp; This corresponds to the <code>CAN_PLAY</code>&nbsp;<code>readyState</code>.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>canplaythrough</code></td> <td>Sent when the ready state changes to <code>CAN_PLAY_THROUGH</code>, indicating that the entire media can be played without interruption, assuming the download rate remains at least at the current level.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>canshowcurrentframe</code></td> <td>The current frame has loaded and can be presented.&nbsp; This corresponds to the <code>CAN_SHOW_CURRENT_FRAME</code>&nbsp;<code>readyState</code>.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>dataunavailable</code></td> <td>Sent when the ready state changes to <code>DATA_UNAVAILABLE</code>.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>durationchange</code></td> <td>The metadata has loaded or changed, indicating a change in duration of the media.&nbsp; This is sent, for example, when the media has loaded enough that the duration is known.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>emptied</code></td> <td>The media has become empty; for example, this event is sent if the media has already been loaded (or partially loaded), and the <a title="en/nsIDOMHTMLMediaElement" rel="internal" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/En/XPCOM_Interface_Reference/NsIDOMHTMLMediaElement"><code>load()</code></a>&nbsp;method is called to reload it.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>empty</code></td> <td>Sent when an error occurs and the media is empty.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>ended</code></td> <td>Sent when playback completes.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>error</code></td> <td>Sent when an error occurs.&nbsp; The element's <code>error</code> attribute contains more information. See <a rel="custom" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Media_events#Error_handling">Error handling</a> for details.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>loadeddata</code></td> <td>The first frame of the media has finished loading.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>loadedmetadata</code></td> <td>The media's metadata has finished loading; all attributes now contain as much useful information as they're going to.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>loadstart</code></td> <td>Sent when loading of the media begins.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>mozaudioavailable</code></td> <td>Sent when an audio buffer is provided to the audio layer for processing; the buffer contains raw audio samples that may or may not already have been played by the time you receive the event.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>pause</code></td> <td>Sent when playback is paused.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>play</code></td> <td>Sent when playback of the media starts after having been paused; that is, when playback is resumed after a prior <code>pause</code> event.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>playing</code></td> <td>Sent when the media begins to play (either for the first time, after having been paused, or after ending and then restarting).</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>progress</code></td> <td>Sent periodically to inform interested parties of progress downloading the media. Information about the current amount of the media that has been downloaded is available in the media element's <code>buffered</code> attribute.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>ratechange</code></td> <td>Sent when the playback speed changes.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>seeked</code></td> <td>Sent when a seek operation completes.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>seeking</code></td> <td>Sent when a seek operation begins.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>suspend</code></td> <td>Sent when loading of the media is suspended; this may happen either because the download has completed or because it has been paused for any other reason.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>timeupdate</code></td> <td>The time indicated by the element's <code>currentTime</code> attribute has changed.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>volumechange</code></td> <td>Sent when the audio volume changes (both when the volume is set and when the <code>muted</code> attribute is changed).</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>waiting</code></td> <td>Sent when the requested operation (such as playback) is delayed pending the completion of another operation (such as a seek).</td> </tr> </tbody>
