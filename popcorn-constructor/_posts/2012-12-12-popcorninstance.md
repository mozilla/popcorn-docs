title: Popcorn Instance
---
# Popcorn( callback | id, optionsObject ) #

## Purpose ##

Creates and returns a new Popcorn instance.

All Popcorn [instance methods](/popcorn-docs/media-methods/), [plugins](/popcorn-docs/plugins/) and callbacks are chained directly from a Popcorn instance, delegated via its prototype. The context will always be the instance itself.

returns a Popcorn instance

## Options ##

* **id** - the id of the video element
* **callback** - instead of specifying an id, Popcorn's constructor can also be used to call a callback function when the DOM is ready ( [more information here](/popcorn-docs/utility-methods/#popcornready) )
* **optionsObject** - an options object for providing additional options to the popcorn instance, things like [frameAnimation](/popcorn-docs/media-properties/#frameanimation) and [frameRate](/popcorn-docs/media-properties/#framerate) can be specified here as well as [plugin defaults](/popcorn-docs/media-methods/#defaults).

## Examples ##

The following code examples show the various ways a Popcorn instance can be created

{% highlight js linenos %}

    Popcorn( "#video-element-id" );

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight js linenos %}

    Popcorn( "#video-element-id", {
      frameAnimation: true
    });

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight js linenos %}

    Popcorn( "#video-element-id", {
      framerate: number
    });

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight js linenos %}

    Popcorn( "#video-element-id", {
      /* defaults */
    });

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight js linenos %}

    Popcorn(function() {
      /* code to execute on DOM ready */
    });

{% endhighlight %}
