# Getting Started #

We urge the video community, Javascript developers, and film makers alike to get involved and help with development in order to ensure an easy to use and adaptable library. There are many ways one can get involved; some include critiquing current work, filling out tickets/bugs, requesting additional functionality, spreading the word, and helping with documentation. Included below are ways to keep track of popcorn.js.
