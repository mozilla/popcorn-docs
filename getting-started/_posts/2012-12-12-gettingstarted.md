# Getting Started #

The Popcorn.js development team wants to encourage the video and media community, JavaScript developers, and film makers alike to get involved and help with development in order to ensure an easy to use and adaptable library. There are many ways one can get involved, including: creating new projects and demos, critiquing current work, filing tickets/bugs, requesting additional functionality, spreading the word, and helping with documentation.
