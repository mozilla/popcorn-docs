  * **out** - End time for this media file

## Instance Methods ##

* **eq( index )** - Return a Popcorn object for the given object from the sourcesArray
  * **index** - The position in the sourcesArray to get the object from
* **play()** - Plays the sequence
* **exec( time, callback )** - Executes a function at a given time in the sequence
  * **time** - The time in the sequence in which **callback** will execute
  * **callback** - The function that we will execute
* **listen( eventName, callback )** - Listen for an event and fire a callback when that event is triggered

{% highlight js linenos %}
    var sequence = Popcorn.sequence(
      "container-id",
      [
        {
          src: "assets/snowdriving.ogv",
          in: 0,
          out: 5
        },
        {

          in: 7,

          in: 3,
          out: 6
        }
    ]);
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight js linenos %}
    var sequence = Popcorn.sequence(...);

    var p = sequence.eq( 0 );

    sequence.listen("play", function() {
      alert("The sequence has started playing");
    });

    sequence.exec( 8, function() {
      alert("8 seconds into the sequence");
    });

    sequence.play();
{% endhighlight %}
