# sequence( containerId, sourcesArray ) #

## Purpose ##

Create sequence of video clips that playback seamlessly.

## Options ##

* `**containerId**` - the id of the HTML element in which the videos will populate
* `**sourcesArray**` - an array of objects, which each contain the following:
  ** `**src**` - path to your media source file
  ** `**in**` - start time for this particular media
  ** `**out**` - end time for this particular media

the sequencer also provides the following methods:

* `**eq( index )**` - return a popcorn object for the given object from the sourcesArray
  ** `**index** `- the position in the sourcesArray to get the object from
* `**play()**` - plays the sequence
* `**exec( time, callback )**` - executes a function at a given time in the sequence
  ** `**time**` - the time in the sequence in which **callback** will execute
  ** `**callback**` - the function that we will execute
* `**listen( eventName, callback )**` - listen for an event and fire a callback when that event is triggered
  `**eventName**` - the name of the event to listen for i.e. play, pause, timeupdate, canplayall, etc
  `**callback**` - the function to run when the event has been fired

## Examples ##

    var sequence = Popcorn.sequence(
                  "container-id",
                  [
                    {
                      src: "assets/snowdriving.ogv",
                      in: 0,
                      out: 5
                    },
                    {
                      src: "assets/snowdriving.ogv",
                      in: 7,
                      out: 10
                    },
                    {
                      src: "assets/snowdriving.ogv",
                      in: 3,
                      out: 6
                    }
                  ]);
