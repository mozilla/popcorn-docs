## Purpose ##

Trigger an event; optionally pass an object of data through to the event handling callback. Allows custom events.

Any of the follow event types may be used with .trigger() : loadstart, progress, suspend, emptied, stalled, play, pause, loadedmetadata, loadeddata, waiting, playing, canplay, canplaythrough, seeking, seeked, timeupdate, ended, ratechange, durationchange, volumechange.

Trigger also accepts custom events.

## Options ##

* `**eventName**` - string. Name of the event to be triggered
* `**dataObject**` - object. Optional data object

## Use Cases ##

* Forcefully trigger an event when something happens, i.e., the video reaches halfway done, so trigger custom event "halfdone" which can be listened for
