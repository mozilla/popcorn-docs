# compose( name, definitionObject, manifest ) #

## Purpose ##

`compose` provides the base logic for effects and works similarly to a traditional Popcorn.js plugin. Create `start` and `end` functions as you would in a typical plugin and add an appropriate effect that will be triggered in each block. Typically this means add an effect on `start` and remove it on `end`, but is in no way limited to this. Compose creates the huge potential for CSS transitions between Popcorn events and depth to the user's experience. `compose` is not limited to effects.

Plugins events will be fired first, followed by composed events.

## Options ##

* `**name**` - a string of the given name for the compose plugin
* `**definitionObject**` -  is an object literal containing typical plugin methods ( setup, start, end ) where the compose logic will live
* `**manifest**` - an optional manifest can be included

## Use Cases ##

* You want a unique effect to be displayed at alongside an already existing plugin
* Create transitions
